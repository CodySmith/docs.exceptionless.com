[**Exceptionless**](http://exceptionless.com) is a new error reporting service that helps you answer important questions about the software that you build.

* Do you know when and how your app is failing?
* Are my users running into issues and walking away?
* What are the top issues that I should be fixing?
* What issues are affecting the most people and would give me the highest ROI when fixed?
* Is my app getting more or less stable with each release over time?

The definition of the word exceptionless is: **to be without exception**. Our product provides real-time error reporting for your apps. It organizes the gathered information into simple actionable data that will help your app become exceptionless!
